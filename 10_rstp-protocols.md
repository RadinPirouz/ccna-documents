# üåê Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) Cheat Sheet

## üîÑ Spanning-Tree Mode Configuration

```bash
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
```

Enable Rapid-PVST+ mode on the switch.

## üå± Port States in RSTP

| State          | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Discarding** | Drops frames (similar to STP Listening)  |
| **Learning**   | Learns MAC addresses but doesn't forward |
| **Forwarding** | Forwards frames and learns MAC addresses |

## üß≠ Port Roles

| Role                | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Root Port**       | Port closest to the root bridge (one per VLAN) |
| **Designated Port** | Forwarding port for a segment                  |
| **Alternate Port**  | Backup to the Root Port                        |
| **Backup Port**     | Backup to the Designated Port (same segment)   |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: "Designated Port" should **not** be blocked; the **Alternate** and **Backup** roles are **blocking** roles.

## üîå Port Types

| Type               | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edge Port**      | Directly connects to end devices (e.g., PCs). Enabled with PortFast. |
| **Point-to-Point** | Connects RSTP-enabled switches (requires full duplex).               |
| **Root Port**      | As per RSTP, the port with the best path to the root bridge.         |

## üì® BPDUs in RSTP

| Type               | Description                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Proposal BPDU**  | Used to propose a new port role |
| **Agreement BPDU** | Used to acknowledge a proposal  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

### Set Root Bridge Priority

```bash
spanning-tree vlan 1-4094 priority 0
```

Makes this switch the root bridge by setting the lowest possible priority.

### Show Spanning-Tree Details

```bash
show spanning-tree detail
```

```bash
show spanning-tree interface <interface> detail
```

---

## ‚ö° PortFast (Edge Port)

### Enable PortFast Globally

```bash
spanning-tree portfast edge default
```

### Enable PortFast on a Specific Interface

```bash
interface FastEthernet0/1
spanning-tree portfast edge
exit
```
